    Generator Function in Python
    A generator function in Python is defined like a normal function, 
    but whenever it needs to generate a value, 
    it does so with the yield keyword rather than return. 
    If the body of a def contains yield, 
    the function automatically becomes a Python generator function.

            A function is an instance of the Object type.
            You can store the function in a variable.
            You can pass the function as a parameter to another function.
            You can return the function from a function.
            You can store them in data structures such as hash tables, lists, â€¦
